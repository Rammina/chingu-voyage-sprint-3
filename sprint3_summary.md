## Summary

Objectively, I think that this was our best Sprint so far.

**Positives:**

- The best part is that we have improved our communication and collaboration as a team.
- We report our status with teammates more often.
- More of us are open to giving and receiving feedback, and asking for help.
- We also started doing pair programming more often, which helps us understand how each teammate codes.
- Fewer duplicate work done (the less we do what someone else already did, the better)

**Negatives/Shortcomings:**

- We may have only finished 60-70% of our tasks assigned for the week, but it is okay because there were unexpected things that happened that interrupted us from working (e.g. getting sick, external/family interruptions, personal life stuff).
- We have to do more work and be more efficient in the coming weeks, if we want to finish the application.
- We still have outdated branches that are not in-sync, and we did not merge the refactored file structure that Seb made yet.
- I think we are not completely familiar with the application's overall structure yet.
